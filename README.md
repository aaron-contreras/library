# Even Better Reads

A library project to practice JS, constructors and extending on a previous small task of creating `Book`s.
If you would like to check it out live, [here](https://aaron-contreras.github.io/library/) it is. :)

## What I improved on with this project?

- Event listeners
- Understanding of Javascript object constructors
- Heavy CSS styling and positioning
